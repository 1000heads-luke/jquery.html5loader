This plug-in creates a nice preloader using html5 canvas API to draw the percentage during the page loading. Now it works just with images but I hope soon it will work also with audio and video objects.

TODO

- testing the plug in and find all the bugs
- create more graphic feature with canvas



DONE 

- branching to extend the preload with AUDIO and VIDEO elements
- fix the bugs with mobile devices 
- try to get the percentage even in the browser that don't support ajax (AJAX REMOVED)
